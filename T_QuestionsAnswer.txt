ASP.NET is a web application development framework used to develop web applications using different back-end programming languages like C#
where C# is used as an object-oriented programming language to develop web applications along with ASP.NET.


Difference between ASP.net and C#

Asp.net                             					C#
It was designed as a framework to be developed			It was designed as programming languages.
using C#


this can be used to develop web application using		It is programming langagues used to develop application along with asp.net.
any languages like C#,VB.Net.

ASP.NET is the medium for these types of programming 		whereas C# is used to write different types of applications such as Web applications, 
languages such as C# to provide APIs (Application		Web services and Windows applications (Standalone apps).
Programming Interfaces) or libraries to ease the 
development process with readymade functionalities



ASP.net life cycle
life cycle includes 2 different stages

asp.net has some specific steps that to be carried out for an applicarion these steps are called life cycle.

so asp.net life cycle divided into 2 groups
1)Application life cycle
2)Page life cycle



1)Application life cycle
Application life cycle is part that starts when the user makes request..this requests
involves serveral stages are
Application start--->object creation--->HTTP Application--->Dispose--->ApplicationEnd



Applicatio start--whenever a user requests an application for accessing a web server first
the request is checked and then the request for accessing  it is provided
Object creation--it helps in holding all the infromation about the request ,cookies and brwoings
 infromation..it also holds http contecxt,htpp request
 and http response by the browser
Http application--it holds back all subsequent infro sent back to the user by the web driver
eg-if we have two diff applications like one is a gaming application and second is social medai 
application then that means there will be http applications that are to be created to process the 
application
Dispose--it helps in erasing the unmanged resources when the objects are no longer needed 
Application end-it helps to unload the memory of an application 
unloading memory means cleaning up the unwanted files in the application.



Page cycle-
page life cycle included page initilization,restoring and excution.
when as asp.net page is called it goes through some phases before the response is sent to the user.

Page request--->page start--->page initilization--->paage load --->validation--->event handling--->
rendering--->unload

page request---when the user request a page the sever checks the request and then compiles the page 
and responds to the user
if the requested servral times then the cache will check the request to see the if the oupute exits or 
not and after that it will send a respose back to the user.
page start--it hold two object --request and response  then requests holds all the information from the
page which was sent when the page was requested and the response holds all the infromation sent back to the user
page initilization--during the page initilization phase all controls are initilized and each controller 
is provided with specific id ,in the page initilization phase themes are also applied to the application

page load--in this phase application is provided with some control propertied and infromation is also checked 
using view state and control state 
validation-when page is excuted the result of those pages are provied in the form of two conditions ,,true and false

event hanglind--it is reponse to the validation phase,in this phase pages are loaded again and display the same 
infromation .in order to overcome this a post back event is called ..this event helps in checking the credentails 
of the user

rendering-it occures when all the response inforamtion has been sent back to the user ..this phase also stores all
 the infromation that is being sent

Unload-it helps to clean all the  unwanted information.it also cleans the memory once the oage output is sent to the
 user.
